## 2D toy data simulation
<br>
This Experiment is a simulation to test if KeFlow can effectively re-construct original distribution of training data.

<br>
<br>

- Train classifier for simulation data

```
python train_classifier.py
```
<br>

- Train KeFlow for hacking training data distribution

```
python train_extractor.py
```

<br>

- Show result in figure
```
python check_result.py
```
